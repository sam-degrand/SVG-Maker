 # SVG Logo Maker

This is a Node.js command-line application that generates a simple logo as an SVG file. It allows users to input text, select colors for the text and shape, and choose from different shapes (circle, triangle, square) for the logo.

The generated SVG logo can be used for various purposes, such as personal projects or as a placeholder logo. It eliminates the need to hire a graphic designer for simple logo needs.
